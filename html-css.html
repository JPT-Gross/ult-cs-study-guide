                        Language. Hypertext, meaning text that can be shown on
                        an electronic device that includes links to other text.
                        Markup Language, meaning a language that can be

                        HTML is the standard markup language for documents sent
                        over the World Wide Web and is interpreted by web
                        browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and
                        Mozilla Firefox. Though its primary use is for making
                        web pages, HTML can be used to markup any document much
                        like Microsoft Word, or Apple's Pages.

                        HTML is written using basic building blocks called
                        elements. An
                        <span class="key-term">element</span> describes where
                        specific HTML areas start and end. These elements
                        include visual components such as paragraphs and
                        headings, as well as non-visual components such as
                        <span class="key-term">metadata</span>: information
                        about the document. Elements typically include tags that
                        indicate where an element begins; called a "<span
                            class="key-term"
                            >start tag</span
                        >", and where an element ends; called an "<span
                            class="key-term"
                            >end tag</span
                        >". Elements may contain
                        <span class="key-term">attributes</span> that can be
                        used to modify their behavior. These attributes
                        typically have an
                        <span class="key-term">attribute name</span> that
                        describes what will be modified and an
                        <span class="key-term">attribute value</span> that
                        describes the modification. Many elements contain
                        content which is the part of the element that is
                        displayed. Elements that do not contain any content are
                        called "<span class="key-term">void</span>" elements.

                        <h2>Construct markup that uses metadata elements</h2>

                            script and noscript elements allow the use of
                            programming code to be written into the document.
                            While, technically the script element supports any
                            language, most browsers only support JavaScript.
                            This exam does not assess any knowledge of
                            JavaScript so we'll only cover a simple example
                            here. The alert function in JavaScript tells the
                            browser to pop up an alert message, and this was
                            written into the script element in the example
                            below. The noscript element allows us to show a
                            message if the user's browser does not support
                            scripts or has scripts disabled. This is also
                            demonstrated in the example below.
                        </li>
                        <div class="example">

                                <script type="text/plain" class="language-html line-numbers"><script>alert("Your browser supports JavaScript!");</scrÑ–pt>

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">style</span>: the style
                            element allows us to write styling rules into the
                            document. The "style" element always goes inside the
                            "head" element. These rules are written in a
                            language called CSS that we will cover in more
                            detail later. For now, review the simple example
                            below.
                        </li>
                        <div class="example">
                            <div class="snippet">
                                <!-- prettier-ignore -->
                                <script type="text/plain" class="language-html line-numbers"><head>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: magenta;
        }
    </style>
</head></script>
                            </div>
                            <div
                                class="result"
                                style="background-color: magenta; color: black"
                            >
                                <p>Hello, world!</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">meta</span>: "meta" elements
                            allow us to define the metadata (data about data)
                            for our document. The "meta" element always goes
                            inside the "head" element. Review the example below,
                            then a breakdown of common "meta" element attributes
                            will follow. Notice that the "meta" elements are
                            void elements and thus have a start tag, but no end
                            tag.
                        </li>
                        <div class="example">
                            <div class="snippet" style="border: hidden">
                                <!-- prettier-ignore -->
                                <script type="text/plain" class="language-html line-numbers"><head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, study, guide" />
    <meta name="description" content="A free HTML/CSS Study Guide" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
</head></script>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">Encoding</span>: On line
                                two of the example above, you'll see a "meta"
                                element with an attribute name of "charset" and
                                an attribute value of "utf-8". "charset" allows
                                us to set what character encoding standard we'd
                                like to use for our document. Don't worry if
                                that sounds a little complicated. utf-8 is the
                                modern encoding that most web pages use as it
                                supports nearly all of the languages and special
                                characters/symbols you would ever need to
                                display.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">keyword</span>: On line
                                three of the example above, you'll see a "meta"
                                element with an attribute name of "name" and a
                                value of "keywords". This sets this "meta"
                                element up to describe which keywords can be
                                used to find this page using a search engine
                                such as Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. Following
                                the "name" attribute is the "content" attribute.
                                Inside of the value for this attribute we can
                                write a list of keywords (seperated by commas),
                                that can help search engines connect our page
                                with users that search for those words.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">description</span>: On
                                line four of the example above, you'll see a
                                "meta" element with an attribute name of "name"
                                and a value of "description". This sets this
                                "meta" element up to give search engines a brief
                                description of our page that can be diplayed
                                when someone searches for our site. The
                                description text is written in the value area of
                                the "content" attribute.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">viewport</span>: On line
                                five of the example above, you'll see a "meta"
                                element with an attribute name of "name" and a
                                value of "viewport". This sets this "meta"
                                element up to tell the browser how we'd like to
                                configure the viewable area of the page. Here,
                                we set the "content" attribute to
                                "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0". That
                                looks very complex, but all it does is set the
                                width of the web page to the width of the
                                browser.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="article-numbers">
                        <h2>Construct well-formed page markup</h2>

                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">!DOCTYPE declaration</span>:
                            While it looks like an element the !DOCTYPE
                            decleration stands outside of the html code and
                            tells the browser what type of document you are
                            writing. For our purposes, this will always be set
                            to html and will look like the example below.
                        </li>

                            holds all of the html code inside of it. The "html"
                            element commonly includes the "lang" attribute which
                            holds a language in its value. To specify that our
                            page is written in American English, we'll use the
                            "en-US" language code in the example below.
                        </li>
                        <div class="example">

                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">head</span>: The "head"
                            element, as we've seen earlier, holds the metadata
                            for the document. We have already seen "meta" and
                            "style" written in "head", but there is one more
                            that is very common. In the example below we will
                            see how the "title" element is used to give the
                            document a title that is displayed in the browser's
                            tab.

                            <span class="key-term">body</span>: The "body"
                            element designates the start and end of the visible
                            area of the document. Elements that display visual
                            content go inside of "body". In the example below we
                            will use the "h1" heading element to show how they
                            are written.

                            <span class="key-term">Proper Syntax</span>: Syntax
                            refers to the specific order and placement of words
                            and symbols. Compared to other programming
                            languages, HTML is very forgiving of syntax
                            mistakes. Of course, that is no excuse for sloppy
                            programming. Start and end tags should be surrounded
                            by opening angle brackets (&lt;) and closing angle
                            brackets (&gt;). Attribute values should be
                            surrounded in double-quotes (").
                            <span class="key-term">Nesting</span> is the act of
                            writing one element inside of another. The "head"
                            and "body" elements are nested inside of the "html"
                            element. Nested elements should be indented to
                            visually show they exist inside of their parent
                            element. Finally, tag and attribute names should
                            always be written in lower case. See the example
                            below for the proper syntax of the minimum HTML
                            required for web page according to HTML5 standards.

                            elements have end tags. As we've seen in previous
                            examples, the "meta" element does not have an end
                            tag. So, when does an element need an end tag, and
                            when doesn't it? The short answer is: an element
                            does not have an end tag if it cannot have any
                            content. In the example below we will see the line
                            break, "br", element. Because this element cannot
                            have any content, it does not use an end tag.

                            and we must use a different method to get them to
                            display on screen. For this we use
                            <span class="key-term">entities</span>, also known
                            as escape codes to get these symbols to show
                            correctly. Entities are also useful for symbols that
                            we'd like to display, but are not on standard
                            keyboards such as &copy;, &reg;, and &cent;. The
                            example below shows some common symbols and thier

                        CSS is written using basic building blocks called
                        rulesets. A
                        <span class="key-term">ruleset</span> consists of one or
                        more selectors which designate what element in the
                        document will be affected. In figure 2-a above, we can
                        see that the <span class="key-term">selector</span> is
                        the "body" element, so everything in the body will be
                        affected. Next, you'll see a property is declared. A
                        <span class="key-term">property</span> is the feature of
                        the element that will be affected. In the figure above,
                        we chose "color" which means the color of the text will
                        change. Finally, you'll see a value is chosen. A value
                        is the aspect of the feature that will be affected. In
                        the figure above, we chose "cyan" which means all of the
                        text in the body will be colored cyan.

                            can be written into an html document in three
                            places. One, directly into an element using the
                            "style" attribute. This is known as
                            <span class="key-term">inline</span>. Two, in the
                            "head" element, using the "style" element. This is
                            known as <span class="key-term">Internal</span>.
                            Three, in a seperate file. This is known as

                            look at the example below where all three techniques
                            are used and then break them down one by one.

                                    Notice that it is written inside an
                                    attribute named "style". It does not need a
                                    selector because it is written directly into
                                    the element that it will be styling.

                                    we can see the internal style being applied.
                                    Notice that it is written inside an element
                                    with the tag name "style", and the ruleset
                                    is indented to make it easier to read.

                                    <span class="key-term">External</span>: On
                                    line 5 in the top-left example above, we see
                                    a new element called "<span class="key-term"
                                        >link</span
                                    >". This allows our HTML document to
                                    communicate with other files. In this case
                                    we are linking to a CSS file that we named
                                    "style.css". The code for this file can be
                                    seen in the top-right example above.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">Precedence</span>: If we take
                            a look at the bottom window of the example above, we
                            can see see that some stylesheets overwrite others.
                            Even though we wrote in the external stylesheet for
                            everything in the "body" element to be blue, only
                            the "h1" element actually displays as blue. This is
                            because external sheets have the lowest
                            <span class="key-term">precedence</span> i.e. rank.
                            The first paragraph element is colored magenta
                            because it was styled in the internal stylesheet,
                            which has precedence over the external stylesheet.
                            Finally, the second paragraph element displays as
                            green because it was styled inline which has the
                            highest precedence.

                            standard syntax that we must follow closely. See the
                            example below, between lines 5 and 19, for properly
                            written CSS.

                            <span class="key-term">Selectors</span>: Selectors
                            in a ruleset are used to specify the part of the
                            document you'd like to style. Refer to the example
                            code above for the explinations below.
                        </li>

                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">Element</span>: On line 6
                                in the example above, we see an element selector
                                being used. Any html element can be used as a
                                selector to style everything contained within
                                that element. Here, we used the paragraph, "p"
                                element to make all of the text in every "p"
                                element green.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">Class</span>: A class is
                                an HTML attribute that allows us to give an
                                element a name. This name can than be used as a
                                CSS selector in a ruleset to style only the
                                elements that share that class. On line 10 we
                                used a class called alert by typing "p.alert" to
                                make every "p" element with that class name have
                                a red background and yellow text. On line 29, we
                                gave a "p" element the "alert" class name by
                                writing the "class" attribute name and giving it
                                the value of "alert". Class names are
                                case-sensitive, meaning that "alert" is
                                different from "Alert".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">ID</span>: An ID is
                                similar to a class, but no element on a page can
                                have the same exact ID name. Each ID name on a
                                page must be unique. On line 15 we used an ID
                                called upside-down by typing "#upside-down" as
                                the selector. We used the "transform" property
                                with a value of "rotate(180deg)" to flip the
                                element we give this ID upside down. On line 32
                                we gave the "p" element the "upside-down" ID by
                                typing the "id" attribute name and giving it a
                                value of "upside-down."
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">Pseudo-Class</span>: A
                                pseudo-class selector allows us to style a part
                                of the page based on specific events. On line 19
                                we used the hover pseudo-class as a selector by
                                typing "a:hover". This will only apply the style
                                to "a" elements that the user is hovering over
                                with their mouse. We are changing the line to be
                                above the text and the color to orange.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">Descendent</span>:
                                Descendent selectors allow us to style only
                                elements of the page that exist inside of other
                                elements. On line 24 we select just the "p"

                                elements by typing "div p" as our selector and
                                we chose a value of "magenta" for the "color"
                                property. Notice that the only "p" element that
                                is colored magenta is the last one which is
                                nested in a "div" element.

                There are over 100 HTML elements in the current version of HTML:
                HTML5. Thankfully, for this exam we only have to remember a
                couple dozen of the most commonly used elements for structuring
                a document.
                <ol class="article-list">
                    <li class="article-numbers">
                        <h2>

                            and organize data
                        </h2>
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">Tables</span>: The "table"
                            element allows us to create tables of data in an
                            HTML document. We use the "tr" element to designate
                            a table-row, the "th" element to designate a
                            table-header, and the "td" element to designate a
                            table-data cell. Notice that if we would like a cell
                            to span across multiple columns we use the "colspan"
                            attribute name and specify the number of columns as
                            the attribute value, in this case: 2.

                            our document's content. Headings can be used for the
                            titles of blog posts or news articles for example.
                            "h1" heading elements are the largest, most
                            prominent headings and "h6" headings are the

                            number in the heading element tag name, the smaller
                            the heading will be.

                            element designates the typical text in a document. A
                            line-break element: "br", is used to break text in a
                            paragraph element onto a new line. The
                            horizontal-rule element: "hr", is used to draw a
                            horizontal line. This is great for breaking a
                            document into sections with visible dividers. Look
                            at the example below to see the code for these
                            elements in action. Notice that like "br" element,
                            "hr" is void, meaning it does not contain any
                            content.

                            CSS. This domain focuses solely on HTML, but you
                            will see some CSS used to move the div to the center

                            two formats: ordered and unordered. To make an
                            ordered list, we use the ordered list element with
                            the tag name of "ol". To make an unordered list, we
                            use the unordered list element with the tag name of
                            "ul". Ordered lists use numbers or letters, while
                            unordered lists use shapes. Regardless of the list
                            type used, we always nest the list item element,
                            with a tag name of "li", inside the list element we
                            are using. See the example below to see these two
                            list types.

                            <span class="key-term">Semantic Elements</span>:
                            Earlier we defined syntax as the placement and order
                            of characters and symbols.
                            <span class="key-term">Semantics</span>, on the
                            other hand, is the meaning that the order of these
                            characters and symbols produce. As long as the
                            syntax is correct, your code will run, but semantics
                            is important for other humans. We want to make our
                            code as readable and understandable as possible. To
                            help with semantic readability, HTML5 introduced
                            semantic elements. Before this, every part of a web
                            page was a seperate div with a class name. For
                            example, the header would look like: &lt;div
                            class="header"&gt;. The problem with this is, unless
                            every web developer sticks to this exact wording, it
                            won't be consistent. With HTML5, we now have the
                            &lt;header&gt; element. Functionally, this is no
                            different from the "div" method, but semantically
                            this is much more consistent and easier to read. See
                            figure 3.2-a above for an example of how a page
                            should be layed out using semantic elements versus
                            the old way of doing it before HTML5.

                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">details/summary</span>:
                                The "details" element allows us to create a part
                                of our page that can be shown and hidden. The
                                "summary" element allows us to give this feature
                                a title. To achieve this, we place the start tag
                                before the parts of our page we'd like to hide,
                                then we place the end tag after. See the example
                                below for a demonstration.

                                The "figure" element is a semantic element for
                                holding pictures, graphs, diagrams, etc. The
                                "figcaption" element is an optional element for
                                giving a figure some caption text to help

                            different spot on the same web page. The "HTML

                            "href" contains the address for the hyperlink as its
                            attribute value. The content of the "anchor" element
                            should clearly indicate the destination of the
                            hyperlink.

                            attribute is used in the "anchor" element to specify
                            where the hyperlink will open. There are several
                            valid values for this attribute, but the two this
                            exam are concerned with are "_self" and "_blank".
                            The default place for a hyperlink to open is in the
                            current tab/window the user is currently in, this is
                            "_self". Sometimes however, we woud like to keep the
                            user on our page and have the hyperlink open in a
                            new tab/window, in which case we use "_blank". Below
                            is an example of the "anchor" element with the
                            "target" attribute set to the "_blank" value.

                            study-guide for example). To create a bookmark,
                            first, give the element where you would like the
                            hyperlink to direct to an ID with the "id"
                            attribute. Second, create an "anchor" element and
                            write the ID in as the value for the "href"
                            attribute. See the example below.

                            : A hyperlink can have two general destinations.
                            One, relative: a link that references a location
                            based on its relation to the current document. Two,
                            absolute: a link that references a specific URL
                            address. A relative link will typically be the name
                            of the file, such as "contact.html" or "index.html".
                            An absolute link is a specific web address such as
                            "https://www.example.com".

                            </span>
                            : Relative hyperlinks are very simple if all of the
                            documents are in the same folder/directory, however,
                            larger websites are often organized using many
                            folders. Use the example below to note the four
                            different ways links are written in the "href"
                            attributes. The folder diagram on the right is a
                            visual representation of the contents of the files
                            that exist on this example website. The code on the
                            left is for the "about.html" page in the "pages"
                            folder.

                                On line 14, we see the simplest link as
                                mentioned earlier. Because "contact.html" exists
                                in the same folder, the link is simply written
                                as its name.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On line 11, we see that to go up one folder in
                                the directory two dots and a forward slash (../)
                                must be written before the name of the file.
                                Because "index.html" exists in the folder above,
                                the link must be written as "../index.html".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On line 17, we see that to go down a folder we
                                write the name of the folder below, then a
                                forward slash. Because "license.html" is in a
                                folder called "sub-pages", and that folder is in
                                the same folder as the current page, we create
                                the link as "sub-pages/license.html".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On line 5, we see that to go up a folder then
                                into a different folder we combine the two
                                previous ideas. We write two dots to go up a
                                folder, then write the name of the folder in the
                                folder above that holds the file we are looking
                                for, then the file name. Because "style.css" is
                                in a folder above called "styles", we write the
                                link as "../styles/style.css".

                            element, along with the "area" element, allows for
                            the creation of images that have spots on them that
                            can be clickable hyperlinks. You'll see in the
                            example below that the "map" and "area" elements can
                            be quite complex. For the exam, all you need to
                            remember is what these elements do and that the
                            "area" element must be nested inside the "map"
                            element. The movie screen is the clickable area of
                            the image in the example.

                        Forms are the primary method for getting user input on a
                        web page. If you have ever made an account on a web
                        page, you have interacted with a form. Forms have text
                        boxes, drop-down menus, buttons, check-boxes and much
                        more. Forms send their input to a database. This exam
                        does not assess our knowledge about databases, so we
                        will only cover the bare minimum about this process.

                            <span class="key-term">Form Attributes</span>: In
                            the "form" element we use two attributes, "action
                            and "method". The
                            <span class="key-term">"action"</span> attribute
                            allows us to type a URL as its value. This URL is
                            the page that processes the user input for the form.
                            The <span class="key-term">"method"</span> attribute
                            specifies how the user input will be sent. The
                            example below shows a simple form. Note that this
                            form will not work correctly because a database
                            server is not running to recieve and process the
                            input.

                            such as changing a password.

                            : as you can imagine, there are a lot of different
                            ways we can collect input from users. We will only
                            cover some of the basic ones here, but if you'd
                            like, here is a more

                            >. As mentioned earlier, we can have simple inputs
                            like text, and checkboxes, but we can also have more
                            complex inputs that restrict what the user may
                            write. For example, below you will see an "email"
                            and "password" input. The "email" input will only
                            allow valid email addresses as input, and "password"
                            will mask what the user types, typically with dots
                            or stars so other people cannot see the input.

                                <span class="key-term">label</span>: the "label"
                                element creates a caption for an input. All
                                inputs should use the "label" element and not
                                the "paragraph" element. The "label" element is
                                important for accessibility, as assistive
                                technology depends on these labels to help users
                                to fill out forms. Also, the label can be
                                clicked to select the input that is associated
                                with it. This helps users to understand what
                                data should go in which input if they are
                                confused by the layout of the form. To associate
                                a label with an input, make sure to write the
                                same value in the "for" attribute in the "label"
                                element as the "id" attribute in the "input"
                                element.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">text</span>: When the
                                "type" attribute has a value of "text" in an
                                "input" element a single-line text-box will
                                appear. You can see this on line 9 of the
                                example above. In the example it is being used
                                to take in a Username from the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">password</span>: When
                                "password" is used as the value, a text box is
                                created just as with "text", but any input into
                                the box is hidden to protect the user's data. In
                                the example above, this is created on line 11.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">email</span>: When
                                "email" us used, a text box is created, but when
                                the form is submitted the page will check if a
                                valid email address was entered. If not, the
                                form will not submit and the user will be
                                prompted to fix their input. In the example
                                above, this is created on line 13.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">select</span>: Unlike the
                                previous input types, "select" is its own
                                element, not an attribute value for the "input"
                                element. The "select" element creates a
                                drop-down box from which the user can select
                                from a list of options. In the example above,
                                the "select" element is started on line 15,
                                ended on line 20, and has the user select from a
                                list of timezones.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">option</span>: the
                                "option" element nests inside of the "select"
                                element and is used to create an item for the
                                drop-down box. In the example, the timezone
                                options are created on lines 16-19.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">textarea</span>: The
                                "textarea" element is like the "input" element
                                with the "type" attribute set to "text", but
                                with a multi-line text box. the "textarea"
                                element has a "cols" attribute for setting how
                                many columns wide the box will start with when
                                the page loads, as well as a "rows" attribute
                                for setting how many rows tall the box will
                                start with. The user can resize the box by
                                dragging the bottom right corner. In the example
                                above, this is created on line 23.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">button</span>: The
                                "button" element creates a button that the user
                                can click to initiate some action on the form.
                                On line 26 a button was created with the "type"
                                attribute set to a value of "reset" which resets
                                all of the form input to their default values.
                                Notice that on line 25 there is an "input"
                                element with the "type" attribute set to
                                "submit". This also create a button that submits
                                the form data. The "button" element could also
                                have been used here instead to achive the same
                                thing.

                            <span class="key-term">img</span>: The "img" element
                            allows us to add images to a web page.
                        </li>

                            <span class="key-term">src</span>: The value in the
                            "src" attribute is where we write the source for our
                            image. While the source can be either a relative or
                            an absolute link, it is best to always use absolute
                            links. This way, we don't have to worry if another
                            website is down or deletes the image.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">alt</span>: The "alt"
                            attribute is for writing a text description that is
                            capable of replacing the image. Not all browsers
                            show images. Some browsers read text to people with
                            visual impairments, others have images turned off
                            for people with slow internet connections. For these
                            reasons it is very important to always have a good
                            description in the "alt" attribute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="key-term">width and height</span>: the
                            "width" and "height" attributes specify the
                            dimensions of the images. There are many units that
                            are supported, but "px", i.e. pixel is the most
                            popular.

                            <span class="key-term">picture/source</span>: The
                            "picture" element allows us to display a different
                            image depending on the display. This is very useful
                            for "responsive" design, which is the process of
                            creating a website that adapts its layout for
                            different sized screens (phones, tablets, desktops,
                            etc). The "source" element nests inside of the
                            "picture" element and describes the images that will
                            be used in the spot on the page. The "media"
                            attribute allows us to specify at what screen width
                            the image should display, and the "srcset" attribute
                            allows us to link the image that will be displayed.

                            <span class="key-term">video</span>: The "video"
                            element is used to insert a video into a web page.
                            Much like the "picture" element, "video" uses nested
                            "source" elements to specify the video we'd like to
                            use. We can also write some fallback text if the
                            user's browser does not support videos.
                        </li>

                                <span class="key-term">autoplay</span>: The
                                "autoplay" attribute can be added to the "video"
                                element's start tag if you'd like the video to
                                play when the page loads. Note that "autoplay"
                                does not have a value so we do not need to
                                include the equal sign or quotation marks (="").
                                This also applies to the next two attributes
                                mentioned below.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">controls</span>: The
                                "controls" attribute can be added to the "video"
                                element's start tag if you'd like the user to
                                see the play/pause button, volume slider, and
                                seek bar. It is a good idea to always add this
                                attribute as user's appreciate the ability to
                                control the video.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">muted</span>: The "muted"
                                attribute can be added to the "video" element's
                                start tag if you'd like the video to start with
                                muted volume. This is a good idea to add if you
                                choose to include the "autoplay" attribute, as
                                users find it annoying to have sound playing the
                                moment a page loads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">track</span>: The "track"
                                element is used to add closed-caption text to
                                the video. the "src" attribute must link to a
                                .vtt file which is a text file that allows the
                                captions to be programmed to show at the time in
                                the video when they are appropriate.
