                            HTML: Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext, meaning
                            text that can be shown on an electronic device that
                            includes links to other text. Markup Language,
                            meaning a language that can be interpreted by a
                            program to style the text.

                            HTML is the standard markup language for documents
                            sent over the World Wide Web and is interpreted by
                            web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
                            and Mozilla Firefox. Though its primary use is for
                            making web pages, HTML can be used to markup any
                            document much like Microsoft Word, or Apple's Pages.

                            HTML is written using basic building blocks called
                            elements. These elements include visual components
                            such as paragraphs and headings, as well as
                            non-visual components such as metadata: information
                            about the document. Elements typically include tags
                            that indicate where an element begins; called "start
                            tags", and where an element ends; called "end tags".
                            Elements may contain attributes that can be used to
                            modify their behavior. These attributes typically
                            have a name that describes what will be modified and
                            a value that describes the modification. Many
                            elements contain content which is the part of the
                            element that is displayed. Elements that do not
                            contain any content are called "void" elements.

                                script and noscript elements allow the use of
                                programming code to be written into the
                                document. While, technically the script element
                                supports any language, most browsers only
                                support JavaScript. This exam does not assess
                                any knowledge of JavaScript so we'll only cover
                                a simple example here. The alert function in
                                JavaScript tells the browser to pop up an alert
                                message, and this was written into the script
                                element in the example below. The noscript
                                element allows us to show a message if the
                                user's browser does not support scripts or has
                                scripts disabled. This is also demonstrated in
                                the example below.
                            </li>

                                <div class="result center">
                                    <img src="/imgs/alert.png" />

                            </div>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">style</span>: the style
                                element allows us to write styling rules into
                                the document. The style element always goes
                                inside the head element. These rules are written
                                in a language called CSS that we will cover in
                                more detail later. For now, review the simple
                                example below.
                            </li>
                            <div class="example">

                                    "
                                >
                                    <p>Hello, world!</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">meta</span>: meta
                                elements allow us to define the metadata (data
                                about data) for our document. The meta element
                                always goes inside the head element. Review the
                                example below, then a breakdown of common meta
                                element attributes will follow. Notice that the
                                meta elements are void elements and thus have a
                                start tag, but no end tag.
                            </li>
                            <div class="example">

                                    <span class="key-term">Encoding</span>: On
                                    line two of the example above, you'll see a
                                    meta element with an attribute name of
                                    "charset" and an attribute value of "utf-8".
                                    "charset" allows us to set what character
                                    encoding standard we'd like to use for our
                                    document. Don't worry if that sounds a
                                    little complicated. utf-8 is the modern
                                    encoding that most web pages use as it
                                    supports nearly all of the languages and
                                    special characters/symbols you would ever
                                    need to display.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="key-term">keyword</span>: On
                                    line three of the example above, you'll see
                                    a meta element with an attribute name of
                                    "name" and a value of "keywords". This sets
                                    this meta element up to describe which
                                    keywords can be used to find this page using
                                    a search engine such as Google, Bing, or
                                    DuckDuckGo. Following the "name" attribute
                                    is the "content" attribute. Inside of the
                                    value for this attribute we can write a list
                                    of keywords (seperated by commas), that can
                                    help search engines connect our page with
                                    users that search for those words.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="key-term">description</span>:
                                    On line four of the example above, you'll
                                    see a meta element with an attribute name of
                                    "name" and a value of "description". This
                                    sets this meta element up to give search
                                    engines a brief description of our page that
                                    can be diplayed when someone searches for
                                    our site. The description text is written in
                                    the value area of the "content" attribute.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="key-term">viewport</span>: On
                                    line five of the example above, you'll see a
                                    meta element with an attribute name of
                                    "name" and a value of "viewport". This sets
                                    this meta element up to tell the browser how
                                    we'd like to configure the viewable area of
                                    the page. Here, we set the "content"
                                    attribute to "width=device-width,
                                    initial-scale=1.0". That looks very complex,
                                    but all it does is set the width of the web
                                    page to the width of the browser.

                                writing. For our purposes, this will always be
                                set to html and will look like the example
                                below.
                            </li>

                                <span class="key-term">html</span>: The "html"
                                element designates the root of the document and
                                holds all of the html code inside of it. The
                                "html" element commonly includes the "lang"
                                attribute which holds a language in its value.
                                To specify that our page is written in American
                                English, we'll use the "en-US" language code in
                                the example below.
                            </li>
                            <div class="example">
                                <div class="snippet" style="border: hidden">
                                    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
                                    <script type="text/plain" class="language-html line-numbers"><!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
</html></script>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <li>
                                <span class="key-term">head</span>: The "head"
                                element, as we've seen earlier, holds the
                                metadata for the document. We have already seen
                                "meta" and "style" written in "head", but there
                                is one more that is very common. In the example
                                below we will see how the "title" element is
                                used to give the document a title that is
                                displayed in the browser's tab.
                            </li>
                            <div class="example">

                                <span class="key-term">body</span>: The "body"
                                element designates the start and end of the
                                visible area of the document. Elements that
                                display visual content go inside of "body". In
                                the example below we will use the "h1" heading
                                element to show how they are written.

                                <span class="key-term">Proper Syntax</span>:
                                Syntax refers to the specific order and
                                placement of words and symbols. Compared to
                                other programming languages, HTML is very
                                forgiving of syntax mistakes. Of course, that is
                                no excuse for sloppy programming. Start and end
                                tags should be surrounded by opening angle
                                brackets (&lt;) and closing angle brackets
                                (&gt;). Attribute values should be surrounded in
                                double-quotes (").
                                <span class="key-term">Nesting</span> is the act
                                of writing one element inside of another. The
                                "head" and "body" elements are nested inside of
                                the "html" element. Nested elements should be
                                indented to visually show they exist inside of
                                their parent element. Finally, tag and attribute
                                names should always be written in lower case.
                                See the example below for the proper syntax of
                                the minimum HTML required for web page according
                                to HTML5 standards.
                            </li>
                            <div class="example">
                                <div class="snippet" style="border: hidden">
                                    <!-- prettier-ignore -->

                                <span class="key-term">End Tags</span>: Not all
                                elements have end tags. As we've seen in
                                previous examples, the "meta" element does not
                                have an end tag. So, when does an element need
                                an end tag, and when doesn't it? The short
                                answer is, an element does not have an end tag
                                if it cannot have any content. In the example
                                below we will see the line break, "br", element.
                                Because this element cannot have any content, it
                                does not use an end tag.

                                for html code. &gt; and &lt; are used to
                                surround elements and we must use a different
                                method to get them to display on screen. For
                                this we use
                                <span class="key-term">entities</span>, also
                                known as escape codes to get these symbols to
                                show correctly. Entities are also useful for
                                symbols that we'd like to display, but are not
                                on standard keyboards such as &copy;, &reg;, and
                                &cent;. The example below shows some common
                                symbols and thier entities in action.
